# Hi there 👋, I'm Jamal Raja  

Recent graduate of **Step8Up Full-Stack Development Level 4 (BCS-accredited)** with hands-on experience building, testing, and deploying full-stack web applications. Comfortable working across the stack, including frontend architecture, backend APIs, authentication flows, and relational database design.

I enjoy solving non-trivial problems, digging into bugs until I understand the root cause, and improving codebases over time rather than treating projects as “finished”. I’m actively looking for a software developer or full-stack developer role where I can contribute to production code, learn from code reviews, and continue developing strong engineering fundamentals.
